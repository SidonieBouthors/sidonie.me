## Computer Science Bachelor & Master

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science.

I have been a teaching assistant for various courses in my time at EPFL.\
In 2025, I even received the *IC School Distinguished Student Assistant Award* 
for my work as an assistant for the Software Construction course. \
Here are the courses I have been a student assistant for:

**Software Construction (CS-214)** in Autumn 2023, 2024 and 2025:
A course  in Scala about software engineering principles and functional programming.

**Computer Language Processing (CS-320)** in Spring 2025 and 2026:
A course in Scala about compiler design and implementation.

**Fundamentals of Digital Systems (CS-173)** in Spring 2024:
A course in Verilog and RISC-V about about hardware, logic gates, and digital design.

**Mentoring for first year Bachelor students** in Autumn 2022 and 2023:
Tutoring for a group of 15 first year Bachelor students.\
I provided guidance and support to help them succeed in their studies and adapt
to university life, and organized weekly work sessions.
