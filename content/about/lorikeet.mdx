## Lorikeet

[Lorikeet](https://github.com/epfl-systemf/lorikeet) is a Scalafix-based code 
quality feedback tool that lets you define custom rules using 
query patterns and rewrite templates in a Scala like DSL. \
It can be used (and was designed) for automated grading and feedback of student assignments at scale, 
but can also serve as a dev tool as it allows more easily writing custom Scalafix rules.

I created Lorikeet in Autumn 2025 as a semester project at the [SYSTEMF lab](https://systemf.epfl.ch/) at EPFL, 
and I have now begun a second semester project to continue my work on it.

This is one of my favorite projects so far: it combines my love for programming languages and compilers 
with my passion for teaching and education, and all that while delving into the Scala AST
and the limits of Scala syntax, which was a really fun challenge.
