## Software Construction (CS-214)

This course, taught in Scala, covers software engineering principles 
such as testing, debugging, and version control, as well as 
functional programming concepts.

I have been a student assistant of this course since it's creation in 2023, and have
been in charge of infrastructure for 2 years now. 
This includes maintaining the CI, autograding infrastructure,
and the setup for the computerized final exam, the first of its kind at EPFL.
