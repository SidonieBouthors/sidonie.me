## Computer Language Processing (CS-320)

This course covers compiler design and implementation, including lexing, parsing, type checking, and code generation.

I have been an assistant for this course for two years, and besides directly 
assisting students with labs and exercices, I have been in charge of autograding for labs,
participating in the development of course material and grading the final projects.
