# Recipe Dump

I created this page to share simple recipes without the hastle of figuring out ingredient amounts, cooking times or detailed instructions.

The main takeaway here is that none of these are really recipes, and you shouldn't try to follow any of them exactly.
They are mainly for inspiration.
Choose your own ingredients, use your own techniques, and hopefully find some ideas here!
