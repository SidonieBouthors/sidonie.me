# Distributed Algorithms Recap

## Reliable Broadcast

- Request: $\langle$ $x$, Broadcast | $m$ $\rangle$ : Broadcasts a message $m$ to all processes
- Indication: $\langle$ $x$, Deliver | $p$, $m$ $\rangle$ : Delivers a message $m$ broadcast by process $p$
### Properties
**Validity**
If a correct process p broadcasts a message m, then p eventually delivers m.

**No duplication**
No message is delivered more than once.

**No creation**
If a process delivers a message m with sender s, then m was previously broadcast by process s.

**Agreement**
If a message m is delivered by some *correct* process, then m is eventually delivered by every *correct* process.

**Uniform Agreement**
If a message m is delivered by some process (whether
correct or faulty), then m is eventually delivered by every correct process.

**FIFO delivery**
If some process broadcasts message m1 before it broadcasts message m2, then no correct process delivers m2 unless it has already delivered m1.

**Causal delivery** 
For any message m1 that potentially caused a message m2 (so m1 → m2), no process delivers m2 unless it has already delivered m1.

**Total order**
Let m1 and m2 be any two messages.
If a *correct* process p delivers m1 without having delivered m2, no *correct* process will deliver m2 before m1.

**Uniform Total Order**
Let m1 and m2 be any two messages.
If a process p delivers m1 without having delivered m2, no process will deliver m2 before m1.

### Failure Detector

**Strong accuracy**
No correct process is ever suspected

**Strong completeness** 
Eventually, every faulty process is permanently suspected by every correct process
### Best Effort Broadcast

  forall q ∈ Π do
    trigger ⟨ pl, Send | q, m ⟩;

upon event ⟨ pl, Deliver | p, m ⟩ do
  trigger ⟨ beb, Deliver | p, m ⟩;
```

- Perfect Failure Detector

```
upon event ⟨ rb, Init ⟩ do
  correct := Π ;
  from[p] := [∅]ᴺ;
  
upon event ⟨ rb, Broadcast | m ⟩ do
  trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | [ DATA , self, m] ⟩;
  
upon event ⟨ beb, Deliver | p, [ DATA , s, m] ⟩ do
  if m ∉ from[s] then
    trigger ⟨ rb, Deliver | s, m ⟩;
    from[s] := from[s] ∪ {m};
    if s ∉ correct then
      trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | [ DATA , s, m] ⟩;

upon event ⟨ P , Crash | p ⟩ do
  correct := correct \ {p};
  forall m ∈ from[p] do
    trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | [ DATA , p, m] ⟩;
```

### Uniform Reliable Broadcast
URB1 : Validity
URB2 : No duplication
URB3 : No creation
URB4 : Uniform Agreement

#### Algorithm : URB

Using
- Best Effort Broadcast
- Perfect Failure Detector

```
upon event ⟨ urb, Init ⟩ do
  delivered := ∅;
  pending := ∅;
  correct := Π ;
  forall m do ack[m] := ∅;
  
upon event ⟨ urb, Broadcast | m ⟩ do
  pending := pending ∪ {(self, m)};
  trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | [ DATA , self, m] ⟩;
  
upon event ⟨ beb, Deliver | p, [ DATA , s, m] ⟩ do
  ack[m] := ack[m] ∪ {p};
  if (s, m) ∉ pending then
    pending := pending ∪ {(s, m)};
    trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | [ DATA , s, m] ⟩;

upon event ⟨ P , Crash | p ⟩ do
  correct := correct \ {p};

function candeliver(m) returns Boolean is
  return (correct ⊆ ack[m]);

upon exists (s, m) ∈ pending such that candeliver(m) ∧ m ∉ delivered do
  delivered := delivered ∪ {m};
  trigger ⟨ urb, Deliver | s, m ⟩;
```
### Causal Broadcast
#### Reliable Causal Broadcast
RB1 - RB4
CO: Causal delivery

**Causality**
A message m1 causally precedes (may have potentially caused) another message m2, written m1 → m2, iff
- FIFO order : some process p broadcasts m1 before it broadcasts m2
- Local order : some process p delivers m1 and subsequently broadcasts m2
- Transitivity : there exists some message m3 such that m1 → m3 and m3 → m2

#### Uniform Causal Broadcast
URB1 - URB4
CO: Causal Delivery

##### No-waiting Algorithm
```
upon event ⟨ crb, Init ⟩ do
  delivered := ∅;
  past := ∅;

upon event ⟨ crb, Broadcast | m ⟩ do
  trigger ⟨ rb, Broadcast | [ DATA, past, m] ⟩;
  past := past ∪ {(self, m)};
  
upon event ⟨ rb, Deliver | p, [ DATA, mpast, m] ⟩ do
  if m ∉ delivered then
    forall (s, n) ∈ mpast do
      if n ∉ delivered then
        trigger ⟨ crb, Deliver | s, n ⟩;
        delivered := delivered ∪ {n};
        past := past ∪ {(s, n)};
    trigger ⟨ crb, Deliver | p, m ⟩;
    delivered := delivered ∪ {m};
    past := past ∪ {(p, m)};
```

##### No-waiting Algorithm (Garbage collected)
Uses a Perfect Failure Detector for garbage collection
```
upon event ⟨ crb, Init ⟩ do
  delivered := ∅;
  past := ∅;
  correct := Π;
  forall m do ack[m] := ∅;
  
upon event ⟨ crash | p ⟩ do
  correct := correct \ {p};
  
upon exists m ∈ delivered such that self ∉ ack[m] do
  ack[m] := ack[m] ∪ {self};
  trigger ⟨ rb, Broadcast | [ACK, m] ⟩;
  
upon event ⟨ rb, Deliver | p, [ACK, m] ⟩ do
  ack[m] := ack[m] ∪ {p};
  
upon correct ⊆ ack[m] do
  forall (s', m') ∈ past such that m' = m do
    past := past \ {[s', m]};
```
##### Waiting Algorithm
Array `VC` is called a vector clock
```
upon event ⟨ crb, Init ⟩ do
  VC := [0]ᴺ;
  pending := ∅;

upon event ⟨ crb, Broadcast | m ⟩ do
  trigger ⟨ crb, Deliver | self, m ⟩
  trigger ⟨ rb, Broadcast | [ DATA, VC, m] ⟩;
  VC[rank(self)] := VC[rank(self)] + 1;
  
upon event ⟨ rb, Deliver | p, [ DATA, W, m] ⟩ do
  if p ≠ self then
    pending := pending ∪ {(p, W, m)};
    while exists (p', W', m') ∈ pending 
    such that W' ≤ V do
      pending := pending \ {(p' , W' , m' )};
      VC[rank(p')] := VC[rank(p')] + 1;
      trigger ⟨ crb, Deliver | p', m' ⟩;
```

### Total Order Broadcast
RB1 - RB4
TO: Total order

Similar to Causal Broadcast but the order is total and not partial. All processes must deliver all messages according to the same order (which does not necessarily need to respect causality or FIFO ordering).

#### Algorithm

Using
- Reliable Broadcast
- Consensus

```
upon event ⟨ Init ⟩ do 
  unordered :=  ∅; ; 
  delivered := ∅; 
  wait := false; 
  sn := 1;

upon event ⟨ toBroadcast, m ⟩ do 
  trigger ⟨ rbBroadcast, m ⟩; 
  
upon event ⟨ rb, Deliver | sm, m ⟩ and (m ∉ delivered) do 
  unordered := unordered ∪ {(sm,m)}; 
  
upon (unordered ≠ ∅) and not(wait) do 
  wait := true;
  trigger ⟨ to, Propose | unordered⟩_sn;

upon event ⟨ to, Decide | decided ⟩_sn do 
  unordered := unordered \ decided; 
  ordered := deterministicSort(decided); 
  for all (sm, m) in ordered: 
    trigger ⟨ toDeliver, sm, m ⟩; 
    delivered := delivered ∪ {m}; 
  sn : = sn + 1; 
  wait := false;
```

#### Equivalence

1. One can build consensus with total order broadcast 
2. One can build total order broadcast with consensus and reliable broadcast 

Therefore, consensus and total order broadcast are equivalent problems in a system with reliable channels

## Consensus
- Request: $\langle$ $x$, Propose | $v$ $\rangle$ : Proposes a value $v$ to all processes
- Indication: $\langle$ $x$, Decide | $v$ $\rangle$ : Decides a value $v$
### Properties
**Validity**
Any value decided is a value proposed

**Agreement**
No two correct processes decide differently

**Termination**
Every correct process eventually decides

**Integrity**
No process decides twice

**Uniform Agreement**
No two processes decide differently

### Regular Consensus
C1: Validity
C2: Agreement
C3: Termination
C4: Integrity

#### Hierarchical Algorithm
Uses a Perfect Failure Detector and Best Effort Broadcast
Incremental rounds where at each round, the corresponding process of that ID is the leader. The leader decides its current proposal and broadcasts. Other non-leader processes wait to either
- deliver the proposal of the leader
- suspect the leader

```
upon event ⟨ Init ⟩ do 
  suspected := ∅;
  round := 1; 
  currentProposal := nil;
  delivered[] := [false]ᴺ;
  broadcast := false;

upon event ⟨ crash, p ⟩ do 
  suspected := suspected ∪ {p};

upon event ⟨ c, Propose | v ⟩ do 
  if currentProposal = nil then
    currentProposal := v;

upon event ⟨ beb, Deliver | p, value ⟩ do 
  currentProposal := value;
  delivered[round] := true;
  
upon event delivered[round] = true 
or p_round ∈ suspected do 
  round := round + 1;

upon event p_round = self 
and broadcast = false 
and currentProposal ≠ nil do 
  trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | currentProposal ⟩;
  trigger ⟨ c, Decide | currentProposal ⟩;
  broadcast := true;
```
### Uniform Consensus
C1, C3, C4
C2: Uniform Agreement

#### Uniform Hierarchical Algorithm
Using a P failure detector
Similar to regular hierarchical consensus but only decide at the end of the last round

```
upon event ⟨ Init ⟩ do
  suspected := ∅;
  round := 1; 
  currentProposal := nil;
  delivered[] := [false]ᴺ;
  broadcast := false;
  decided := false;

upon event ⟨ crash, p ⟩ do 
  suspected := suspected ∪ {p};
  
upon event ⟨ uc, Propose | v ⟩ do 
  if currentProposal = nil then 
    currentProposal := v;

upon event ⟨ beb, Deliver | p_round, value ⟩ do 
  currentProposal := value; 
  delivered[round] := true;

upon event delivered[round] = true 
or p_round ∈ suspected do 
  if round = n and decided = false then 
    trigger ⟨ uc , Decide | currentProposal ⟩;
    decided = true;
  else 
    round := round + 1;

upon event pround = self 
and broadcast = false 
and currentProposal ≠ nil do 
  trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | currentProposal ⟩; 
  broadcast := true;
```

#### Uniform Consensus Algorithm
Assuming
- a correct majority
- a \<\>P failure detector

##### Fail-Noisy failure detector \<\>P
**Strong Completeness**
Eventually every process that crashes is permanently suspected by all correct processes

**Eventual strong accuracy**
Eventually no correct process is suspected by any process.
Strong accuracy holds only after finite time.
Correct processes may be falsely suspected a finite number of times.

##### Algorithm
- Round based with infinite rounds (until decision is made)
- Leader is index round mod N and tries to decide
- Processes inform the leader and move to the next round if they suspect them
- Leader selects among a majority the latest adopted value
- Leader imposes the value. Any process in that majority adopts it. If leader is suspected, it fails
- Leader decides and broadcasts the decision


## Terminating Reliable Broadcast

Similarities:
- Like Reliable broadcast: correct processes in TRB agree on the set of messages they deliver
- Like Uniform Reliable Broadcast: every correct process in TRB delivers every message delivered by any process 
Difference
- Unlike Reliable Broadcast: every correct process delivers a message, even if the broadcaster crashes
### Properties
**Integrity**
If a process delivers a message m, then either m is φ or m was broadcast by src 

**Validity**
If the sender src is correct and broadcasts a message m, then src eventually delivers m 

**Agreement**
For any message m, if a correct process delivers m, then every correct process delivers m 

**Uniform Agreement**
For any message m, if a any process delivers m, then every correct process delivers m 

**Termination**
Every correct process eventually delivers exactly one message
### Consensus-Based Uniform TRB
TRB1: Integrity
TRB2: Validity
TRB3: Integrity
TRB4: Uniform Agreement

Using perfect failure detector

```
upon event ⟨ Init ⟩ do
  prop := ⊥;
  
upon event ⟨ utrb, Broadcast | m ⟩ do
  trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | m ⟩;
  // only process src

upon event ⟨ crash | src ⟩ do
  if proposal = ⊥ then
    proposal := φ;
    trigger ⟨ uc, Propose | proposal ⟩;
  
upon event ⟨ beb, Deliver | src, m ⟩ do
  if proposal = ⊥ then
    proposal := m;
    trigger ⟨ uc, Propose | proposal ⟩;

upon event ⟨ uc, Decide | decision ⟩ do
  trigger ⟨ utrb, Deliver | src, decision ⟩;
```

### P using TRB

Consider every process can use an infinite number of instances of TRB where they are the sender (src).
Every process keeps on TRB broadcasting messages infinitely.
If any process delivers φ, it suspects the sender of φ.

P is implementable using TRB, therefore P is necessary to implement TRB.
## Non-Blocking Atomic Commit

### Transaction

Atomic program describing a sequence of accesses to shared and distributed information

Can be terminated either by *committing* or *aborting*
#### ACID Properties

**Atomicity**
A transaction either performs entirely or none at all 

**Consistency**
A transaction transforms a consistent state into another consistent state 

**Isolation**
A transaction appears to be executed in isolation 

**Durability**
The effects of a transaction that commits are permanent

#### Consistency Contract

System: Atomicity Isolation Durability
Programmer: Consistency (local)

$\implies$ Consistency (global)

### Properties

**Agreement**
No two processes decide differently

**Termination**
Every correct process eventually decides 

**Commit-Validity**
1 can only be decided if all processes propose 1 

**Abort-Validity**
0 can only be decided if some process crashes or votes 0

### Principle
NBAC1: Agreement
NBAC2: Termination
NBAC3: Commit-Validity
NBAC3: Abort-Validity

As in consensus, every process has an initial value 0 (no) or 1 (yes) and must decide on a final value 0 (abort) or 1 (commit) 
The proposition means the ability to commit the transaction 
The decision reflects the contract with the user 
Unlike consensus, the processes here seek to decide 1 but every process has a veto right

### Algorithm
Using BEB, Perfect Failure Detector and Uniform Consensus

```
upon event ⟨ Init ⟩ do 
  prop := 1; 
  delivered := ∅; 
  correct := Π;
  
upon event ⟨ crash, p ⟩ do 
  correct := correct \ {p} 

upon event ⟨ nbac, Propose | v ⟩ do 
  trigger ⟨ beb, Broadcast | v ⟩; 
  
upon event ⟨ beb, Deliver | p, v ⟩ do 
  delivered := delivered ∪ {p}; 
  prop := prop * v;
  
upon event correct \ delivered = empty do 
  if correct ≠ Π 
    prop := 0; 
  trigger ⟨ uc, Propose | prop ⟩; 
  
upon event ⟨ uc, Decide | decision ⟩ do 
  trigger ⟨ nbac, Decide | decision ⟩;
```

\<\>P is not enough
## Group Membership

Similarities
- Like failure detectors: the processes are informed about failures; we say that the processes install views
- Like perfect failure detector: the processes have accurate knowledge about failures
Differences
- Unlike perfect failure detectors: the information about failures is coordinated (the processes install the same sequence of views)

### Properties

**Local Monotonicity**
If a process installs view (j,M) after installing (k,N), then j > k and M < N 

**Agreement**
No two processes install views (j,M) and (j,M') such that M ≠ M' 

**Completeness**
If a process p crashes, then there is an integer j such that every correct process eventually installs view (j,M) such that p ∉ M 

**Accuracy**
If some process installs a view (i,M) and p ∉ M, then p has crashed

### Algorithm

Using 
- Perfect failure detector
- Uniform Consensus

```
upon event ⟨ Init ⟩ do 
  view := (0, Π); // (id, memb)
  correct := Π; 
  wait := true;

upon event ⟨ crash, p ⟩ do 
  correct := correct \ {p};
  
upon event (correct ⊊ view.memb) and (wait = false) do 
  wait := true; 
  trigger ⟨ uc, Propose | (view.id + 1, correct) ⟩;

upon event ⟨ uc, Decided | (id, memb) ⟩ do 
  view := (id, memb); 
  wait := false; 
  trigger ⟨ memb, View | view ⟩;
```

## View Synchronous Communication

View synchronous broadcast is an abstraction that results from the combination of group membership and reliable broadcast. It ensures that the delivery of messages is coordinated with the installation of views

### Events

**Request**
⟨vs, Broadcast | m⟩
⟨vs, BlockOk⟩

**Indication**
⟨vs, Deliver | src, m⟩
⟨vs, View | V⟩
⟨vs, Block⟩

### Properties

Properties of Group Membership and Reliable Broadcast (and Uniform Reliable Broadcast for Uniform View Synchrony)

**View Synchrony**
A message is vsDelivered in the view where it is vsBroadcast

### TRB-Based Algorithm

upon ⟨ trb, Deliver | p, (vid, del) ⟩ do 
  trbDone := trbDone ∪ {p}; 
  forall m ∈ del and m ∉ delivered do 
    delivered := delivered ∪ {m}; 
    trigger ⟨ vs, Deliver | src, m ⟩;

upon (trbDone = view.memb) 
and (blocked = true) do 
  view := nextView;
