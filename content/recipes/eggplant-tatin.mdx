<Instructions> 
1. Slice the **eggplants** into thin slices and sprinkle with salt. 
Let them sit for 10 minutes to release some of their moisture.
2. Cook the eggplant slices, either in batches in a pan with a bit of oil, 
or on a baking sheet in the oven, until they are soft and slightly browned.
3. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. 
4. Dice the **onion** and **garlic** and cook them with some olive oil 
in a pan. Add the **tomato paste** and cook for a few minutes, 
adding a little water to reach a thick sauce consistency.
Season with **salt**, **herbes de Provence**, and **cayenne pepper**.
5. Add some **honey** and **olive oil** to the bottom of a round baking dish.
6. Arrange all the eggplant slices in layers in the dish.
7. Spread the tomato sauce over the eggplant, then crumble some of the **feta cheese** on top.
8. Roll out the **puff pastry** and place it over the dish, tucking in the edges. 
Make a few slits on the top to let steam escape.
9. Bake for 20-30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.
10. Let the tarte tatin cool a little, then carefully flip it over onto a plate.
Make sure not to wait too long, or the caramelized honey will stick to the dish.
11. Add some more crumbled **feta cheese** on top before serving as a final touch.
11. Enjoy !

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
Make sure the eggplant slices are well cooked before assembling the tarte tatin, 
nobody likes raw eggplant!

If your honey is too thick to spread, you can warm it up a little. I sometimes put 
my baking dish on the stove over low heat with the honey and olive oil,
to make it easier to spread on the bottom.
