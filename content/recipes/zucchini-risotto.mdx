<Ingredients>
|               |               |
| :------------ | ------------: |
| Risotto Rice  |         500g  |
| Zucchini      |   3 medium    |
| Onion         |    2 large    |

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>
1. Cut up your **onions**, **zucchini**, and **mushrooms** into cubes, and chop your **garlic** very finely.
2. Add **olive oil** to a pot on medium-high heat and sauté your onions and garlic until lightly golden and translucent.
3. Add the mushrooms and zucchini to the pot, and let all the veggies cook, stirring frequently.
4. In a smaller pot, dissolve the **stock cube** in boiling water to make your stock.
5. Once the veggies are cooked through, add the **risotto rice** and start a timer with the time indicated on the package.
6. Add the **stock** little by little as the rice cooks and absorbs it. The rice should not be submerged, but there should be enough water for the rice to cook.
7. Stir frequently as the rice cooks.
8. Once the timer goes off, taste to make sure the rice is cooked through, then add the **cold butter** and **parmesan**.
9. Season to taste with **salt** and **black pepper**, top with more parmesan, and serve hot.
10. Enjoy!
</Instructions>

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
Stir the risotto constantly as it cooks, as it can easily stick to the bottom and burn.  

If possible, keep the pot of stock over the heat, so that it remains hot as you add it to your risotto.
