<Instructions>
1. Cut off the top and bottom ends of each **orange** and make a few cuts down the length of the peel.
2. Carefully remove the peel without breaking it and cut it into thin strips.
3. Boil the orange peel in water for 5 minutes, rinse under cold water, and repeat. This removes excess bitterness from the peels.
4. Mix together 250mL of **water** and the **sugar** in a pot to prepare a syrup. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
5. Add the peels and let simmer for 5 minutes. Let everything cool completely, and bring to a boil a second time for another 5 minutes.
6. Once the syrup is completely cooled, remove the confit peels from the pot and place them on a tray or rack to cool (for at least a few hours, ideally overnight).
7. In a bowl, melt the **chocolate**. To do this, put it on high heat for 30 seconds at a time in the microwave. Each time, take it out and stir well. It should be barely melted, and not hot.
8. Dip each dry orange peel in chocolate, making sure to remove any excess, to get a thin and even coating.
9. Place on parchment paper or aluminum foil to set. If your chocolate was not properly tempered and the chocolate does not set at room temperature, place in the fridge.
10. Once the chocolate is set, the orangettes are done!
11. Enjoy!

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
It is crucial to let the confit peels **dry overnight**. If they are still wet, the chocolate coating may flake off, and the texture will be too soft.

The key to this recipe is properly **tempering** the chocolate. It should never reach a temperature higher than your lips, or it will not set properly.
