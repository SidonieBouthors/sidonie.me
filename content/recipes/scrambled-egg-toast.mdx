<Ingredients>
|  |  |
| :---|---: |
| Whole Grain Bread | 5 medium slices |
| Egg | 2 medium |
| Unsalted Butter | 2 tbsp |
| Fresh Basil | a couple leaves |
| Black Pepper | to taste |
| Salt | to taste |
</Ingredients>

<Instructions>
1. Add a tablespoon of **butter** to a pan on medium heat until melted and foamy.
2. Place the slices of **bread** into the pan and let them toast until golden brown. Flip and let the other side toast as well.
3. While the bread toasts, whisk the **eggs** in a bowl until they are fully homogenous. Season them with salt.
4. Once the bread is toasted, remove from the heat. Let the pan cool or use a cold pan, and set over low heat.
5. Add a tablespoon of butter to the pan, and once melted, add the eggs. Stir constantly and keep the pan on low heat to achieve a creamy consistency.
6. Once the eggs are cooked but still slightly runny, spoon them over the toasted slices of bread.
7. Add some chopped **fresh basil** on top and a generous amount of **cracked black pepper**.
8. Enjoy!
</Instructions>

<InfoBox title="Tip!">

You can also do some toasts with different **toppings**, such as caramelised onions, for a more varied breakfast. 

If you make your scrambled eggs in a very **hot** pan, you will not get a creamy **texture**, and they may overcook.

Salting the eggs and whisking them thoroughly greatly **improves** your scrambled eggs !
