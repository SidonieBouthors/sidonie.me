<Instructions>
1. Peel and cut your **onions** into rings, or slice them thinly into a julienne.
2. In a bowl, add the **vinegar**, **sugar**, **salt**, and **spices**. Add the **boiling water** and stir until the salt and sugar is dissolved.
3. Add the onions into the bowl, making sure they are fully **submerged** in the brine.
4. Leave the bowl out until the brine has **cooled** to room temperature.
5. Add the pickled onions to a jar and fill with enough brine to cover. Store your pickled onions in the **fridge** for up to two weeks.
6. Enjoy!
</Instructions>

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
You can alter the **brine** to suit your taste by using different kinds of vinegars and spices, or by leaving out the sugar.

**Red onion** is usually the best kind for pickling, but a similar method can be applied to pickle **carrots** or **cucumbers**.

You can eat the onions by themselves, or add them as a **topping** on a salad or dish, for some extra acidity and crunch.
