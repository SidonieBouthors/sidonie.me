| :--------------------------- | ----------------: |
| Frozen Raspberries              |              500g |

</Ingredients>

<Instructions>
1. Before starting, defrost the **frozen raspberries** and drain out any excess liquid. Alternatively, use fresh raspberries.
2. Find a cylindrical dish suitable for molding the charlotte, such as a deep round glass dish.
3. Arrange the **ladyfinger biscuits** vertically around the sides of the dish, ensuring they are tightly packed with the sugar-coated side facing outwards.
4. Place biscuits on the bottom of the dish, facing down, cutting some to fit if necessary to cover the entire bottom.
5. Spoon a layer of **greek yogurt** (or fromage blanc) into the dish, followed by a layer of **raspberries**, and another layer of yogurt.
6. Add a second layer of biscuits, cutting to fit if needed, then repeat the layers of yogurt and raspberries.
7. Continue layering until the dish is filled, finishing with a layer of biscuits to seal.
8. Cover the dish with a plate or lid and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Ideally the lid should press down on the charlotte. This helps the charlotte maintain its shape when unmolded.
9. After chilling, carefully invert the charlotte onto a plate.
10. Enjoy!

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
Adjust the amount of **biscuits** and **layers** based on the size of your dish.

For added sweetness, consider sprinkling **sugar** over the yogurt or raspberries before assembling. 
You can also **dip** the biscuits in simple syrup or juice before assembling, to make the charlotte more **moist**.

Experiment with different fillings like **canned pears**, **canned pineapple**, or other **berries**.
