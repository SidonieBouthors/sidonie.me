<Instructions>
1. Cook the **eggs** in boiling water for 6 minutes, then immediately transfer to an ice bath (bowl with ice cubes and cold water).
2. Peel and very finely dice the **onion** and the **carrot**. Add the **butter** to a pot on medium-high heat, and once melted add the onion and carrot.
3. Sautee the onions and carrots until golden, then deglaze with a little bit of water.
4. Finely dice the **garlic** and **ginger** and add them to the pot along with 4 cups of **water**.
5. Add the **stock cube** and let it dissolve into the broth. Season to taste with **soy sauce** and **cayenne pepper**.
6. While the broth cooks on low heat, cook the **noodles** separately and drain.
7. Optionally, you can peel and quick-marinate your eggs in a few tbsp of **soy sauce** and 1 tbsp **sugar**. Heat up the marinade and let the eggs sit, rotating them every few minutes until the exterior is slightly brown and has soaked up some of the flavor.
8. Once all the components are ready, add some noodles to each bowl.
9. Top the noodles with the broth, an egg sliced in half, and some sliced **green onions**.
10. Enjoy!
