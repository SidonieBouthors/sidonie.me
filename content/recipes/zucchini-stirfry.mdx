## Instructions

<Instructions>
1.  Wash the **zucchinis** and cut them into thin ribbons.
2.  Peel the **onions** and thinly slice them.
3.  In a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat, add the **olive oil** and **sesame oil**, as well as the veggies once the pan is hot.
4.  Slowly add the **soy sauce**, **sugar** and **cayenne pepper** to the pan. These can be adjusted to suit your taste. There should not be large amounts of liquid, this should act as a glaze.
5.  Once the veggies are cooked and slighlty caramelized, but not overly soft, add the **sesame seeds** and remove from the heat.
6.  While you cook the veggies, wash the **rice** by adding it to a pot and rinsing it multiple times until the water is mostly clear.
7.  Add about an equal volume of **water** to the rice and set over high heat with a lid until it begins to boil, then reduce the heat and continue to cook until most of the water is absorbed (about the time on the package).
8.  Remove from the heat and let **steam** with the lid on for another 5 minutes.
9.  When both the stirfry and rice is ready, serve!
10. Enjoy!

<InfoBox title="Tip !">
Add **coriander leaves** or **marinated ginger** as garnish to further improve this dish.

This **method** of cooking the rice makes fluffy rice every time. Use a **rice cooker** for even better results !
