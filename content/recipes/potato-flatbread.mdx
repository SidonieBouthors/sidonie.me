<Instructions>
1. Cook the **potatoes** until soft, then rinse under cold water to cool.
2. Peel and mash the cooled potatoes, trying to avoid any lumps.
3. In a small pot, heat some oil on medium-low heat. Add the **cumin** and **coriander** seeds.
4. Fry the spices until fragrant, then pour the oil and spices into the potato mixture.
5. Add the **turmeric** and **salt** to taste and mix well.
6. Form a mound of flour on a flat surface and add a few pinches of salt, then form a well in the middle.
7. Add water a little at a time, mixing with a fork, then with your hand, until a soft sticky dough is formed.
8. Divide the dough into equal pieces. Form these pieces into smooth balls.
9. Slightly flatten each ball and place a ball of the potato mixture in the center. Pull the dough around and **pinch** it at the top as if closing a dumpling. Then turn the stuffed dough upside down and gently **flatten** it.
10. Heat a pan on medium-high heat (Make sure it is **hot** before cooking your first flatbread, or it may become dry).
11. When the pan is hot, place the flatbread onto it.
12. Flip when one side is **charred**, and once fully cooked, place aside. Repeat the process with all the other flatbread.
13. Make sure to **taste** the first flatbread to make sure it is cooked through, and that the dough and potato mixture have the right amount of salt.
14. Enjoy!

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
Never forget the **salt** in any bread dough recipe!  

Always use a **very hot pan** to cook flatbread, or they dry out.  

These flatbreads can also be made plain without a stuffing, or stuffed with various other ingredients, such as cheese. Feel free to experiment!
