<Instructions>
1. Cut the **eggplant** into slices and cook them 
in a pan with a little oil, or in the oven, 
until soft.
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C.
1. Finely dice the **onions** and sautée them 
in a pot until translucent, then add the 
**tomato puree** and season to taste with 
**salt**, **cayenne pepper**, and **thyme** 
or other dried herbs such as rosemary.
1. In a separate pot, melt the **butter**, 
then add the **flour** and cook on medium 
low for a few minutes while mixing well. 
Then incorporate the **milk**, whisking 
to avoid lumps, and bring the mixture back 
up to a simmer. Stir constantly and 
once the mixture has thickened to a 
béchamel consistency, remove from the heat. 
Season with **salt**, **pepper** and **nutmeg**.
1. Assemble the lasagna in a rectangular oven dish. 
Start with a small layer of tomato sauce, 
then alternate lasagna sheets, tomato sauce, 
eggplant slices, béchamel, and repeat. 
You should have about 3 layer, but this may vary 
with the size of the dish. 
End with a layer of tomato sauce or béchamel, 
to avoid burning on the top.
1. Bake in the oven at 180°C for about 30 minutes.
1. Enjoy!

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
Add some **grated cheese** on top towards the end of the cooking time for a nice crust.

**Salt** the eggplant slices and let them sit for a while, so they soften faster when cooking. You can also
**press** them down in the pan.

Cook with your **little sister** for a better lasagna experience.
