<Ingredients>
|         |                     |
| :------ | ------------------: |
| Flour   |       3 cups / 375g |
| Olive Oil |         1.5 tbsp |
| Water   |     1 cup / 240ml |
| Dry Yeast |    1 packet / 2.5 tsp |
| Salt    |           2.5 tsp |
</Ingredients>

<Instructions>
1. Warm your **water** in the microwave (it should be **lukewarm** to the touch, not too hot).
2. In a bowl, add the **yeast** to the water and slowly add **2 cups / 250g of flour** (not all the flour!).
3. Stir well and let the mixture rest until you see bubbles form (this should take only a few minutes: if bubbles do not form, your yeast may be expired).
4. Add in the **oil** and the **salt**.
5. Add the flour a little at a time, mixing with your hand until the dough forms a smooth ball and does not stick to your hands too much (you may not need to use all the flour).
6. Knead for about 5 minutes.
7. Oil the bottom of the bowl, place the dough back in, cover with a damp kitchen towel, and let the dough rise for **2 hours**.
8. Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into **8 equal pieces**. Form these pieces into smooth balls.
9. Cover the balls with the damp kitchen towel and let rest for **30 more minutes**.
10. Roll each ball into shape using a floured rolling pin, and optionally let rest for 5 more minutes before cooking (for optimal puffiness!).
11. Heat a pan on medium-high heat. Make sure it is hot before cooking your first Pita.
12. Place a Pita onto the hot pan and cook until one side is charred. Flip and cook until fully cooked, pressing gently with a spatula if needed.
13. Repeat the process with the remaining pitas.
14. It is a good idea to taste the first pita to make sure it is cooked through.
15. Enjoy!

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
Never forget the **salt** in any bread dough recipe!

Always use a **very hot pan** to cook flatbread, or they will dry out.

Pita bread goes very well with some **Falafel**, raw veggies, and yogurt sauce.
