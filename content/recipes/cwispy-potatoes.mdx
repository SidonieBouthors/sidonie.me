<Instructions>
1. Cook the **potatoes** by either boiling or steaming them until they are cooked through, but not overcooked.
2. In a bowl, add the **olive oil** and the **herbs**.
3. Separate the cloves of **garlic** but do not peel them, and add them to the olive oil.
4. Let the oil infuse as you prepare the potatoes.
5. Place the potatoes on a baking tray and lightly **smash** them with a large flat spoon. This increases surface area and creates more browning.
6. Pour the oil, herbs, and garlic over the potatoes and season to taste with **coarse salt**.
7. Bake in the oven at 210Â°C for 40 minutes or until crispy and golden brown.
8. Enjoy!
</Instructions>

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
The **garlic** burns very easily, so do not overbake the potatoes.

**Flatten** the potatoes but do not **mash** them into puree. They should retain their structural integrity.
