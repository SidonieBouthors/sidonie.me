2. Spread the **Dijon mustard** onto the bottom of the pastry and sprinkle with **herbs**.
3. Add a layer of **Gruyère cheese** over the mustard.
4. Wash the **tomatoes** and cut them into medium thin slices.
5. Cover the surface of the tart with an even layer of tomato slices. They may overlap a little.
6. Season with **salt** and **pepper**.
7. Bake in the oven at 200°C for about 20 minutes, until the pastry is cooked.
8. Enjoy!
</Instructions>

<InfoBox title="Tip!">
The **Gruyère cheese** creates a seal, that stops the tomato juices from making the bottom of the pastry **soggy** while it cooks.  

Use **whole grain** or **smooth** mustard depending on your preference!  

This is a great recipe for a **Summer** lunch, along with some salad.
