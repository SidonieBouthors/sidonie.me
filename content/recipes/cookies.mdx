<InfoBox title="Tip !">
**Refrigerate** the dough a little before baking to make it easier to handle.

If you have one, use a **stand mixer** or **hand mixer** to cream the butter and sugar together, and to mix in the other ingredients.

These cookies are more **cakey** than chewy or crispy! They are fluffy and delicious. What is your cookie preference?
